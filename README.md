# Sign Up Form Project

For this project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Curriculum, I built a basic sign-up form using the skills I learned throughout the first portion of the intermediate HTML and CSS course.

### New Skills
- HTML Tables
- Default browser styles
- CSS units
- CSS overflow, opacity, font-styling, borders, box-shadow
- CSS pseudo selectors, classes, and elements
- More advanced positioning concepts
- CSS functions (eg. calc(), min(), max(), and clamp())
- CSS custom properties and browser compatibility
- Forms and client side form validation
